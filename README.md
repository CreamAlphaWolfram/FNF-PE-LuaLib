# FNF-PE-LuaLib
Oh nothing  
It's just some sorts of Friday Night Funkin' Cream take lib  
And no I take <b>no</b> responsibility
## Will I update this?
Hell yea but bruh how about saying no  
Y'know I'm lazy  
So I'll probably leave this *not* up-to-date
## Requirements
Have this [Friday Night Funkin: Psych Engine](https://github.com/shadowmario/fnf-psychengine) link cuz that's all this shit needs  
Also not capable with low-end PCs and laptops probably
## How to install?
Hmm...

1. Download
2. Copy the Lua
3. Put it in \[PsychEngine\]\\mods\\scripts and kaboom it works

also if you want to add smth into it just pull request, and if you find smth uncapable, check the version it does capable and if it is, UGH **REPORT THE ISSUE**
## Current version?
Ugh. *0.1*. Capable with *0.6.2*.
## And, remember...
$E=mc^2$  
And don't press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> ANYWHERE.

## ...don't mind me, just testing the code function.
```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++>
using namespace std;
pair<int, int> c=make_pair(4,4)
int main(){
    cout << "holly molly, why am i testing this shit here?" << endl;
    cout << c.first << " " << c.second << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
