# FNF-PE-LuaLib (CreamyModify)
Oh nothing  
It's just some sorts of Friday Night Funkin' CreamyModify Lua lib  
And no I take <b>no</b> responsibility /j
## Will I update this?
Hell yea but bruh how about saying no  
Y'know I'm lazy  
So I'll probably leave this *not* up-to-date
## Requirements
Have this [Friday Night Funkin: Psych Engine](https://github.com/shadowmario/fnf-psychengine) link cuz that's all this shit needs  
Also not capable with low-end PCs and laptops probably
## How to install?
Hmm...

1. Download
2. Copy the Lua
3. Put "custom settings and (blah blah blah).lua" in \[PsychEngine\]\\mods\\scripts and kaboom it works
4. Put "events.lua" in \[PsychEngine\]\\mods\\customEvents (or whatever it is named) (doesn't work rn)

also if you want to add smth into it just pull request, and if you find smth uncapable, check the version it does capable and if it is, UGH **REPORT THE ISSUE**  
also function library.lua doesn't work rn so don't expect anything on it
## Current version?
Ugh. *0.9.2, 1w25a*. Capable with *0.6.2*.

GitHub Desktop sometimes sucks y'know.
